    <h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This report summarizes the security findings derived from analyzing the specified log file, which documents a red team exercise involving enumeration and exploitation of vulnerabilities on a target system (e.g., http://localhost:5000/). The analysis identified multiple vulnerabilities, including Critical issues like SSRF, which could lead to unauthorized access and data exposure. In total, 5 vulnerabilities were categorized: 1 Critical, 2 High, 1 Medium, and 1 Low.</p>
        <p>Key highlights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="critical">Critical</span>: SSRF vulnerability allowed potential internal network access.</li>
            <li><span class="high">High</span>: SQL Injection and Path Traversal posed risks of data breaches.</li>
            <li><span class="medium">Medium</span>: IDOR could enable unauthorized data viewing.</li>
            <li><span class="low">Low</span>: Stored XSS, while present, had limited impact in the observed context.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Recommendations include immediate patching, input validation, and network segmentation to mitigate these risks. The overall risk level is High due to the potential for privilege escalation and flag capture (e.g., FLAG{ssrf_success_flag}).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Scope and Methodology</h2>
        <p><strong>Scope:</strong> This assessment covers vulnerabilities and evidence extracted from the log file, which includes session events, HTTP requests, and exploitation attempts on http://localhost:5000/. The file contains data from a simulated red team operation on a Linux-based system (Kali Linux 6.12.33).</p>
        <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> The log file was retrieved and parsed to identify security events. Vulnerabilities were categorized by severity based on CVSS guidelines:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="critical">Critical</span>: Immediate exploitation potential leading to full system compromise.</li>
                <li><span class="high">High</span>: Significant risk with potential for data loss or unauthorized access.</li>
                <li><span class="medium">Medium</span>: Moderate risk requiring specific conditions to exploit.</li>
                <li><span class="low">Low</span>: Minimal impact, often informational.</li>
            </ul>
            Tools used included command-line utilities for file access and analysis. No interactive sessions were initiated during report generation.

                <h4>Path Traversal</h4>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Directory traversal was possible through manipulated file paths in requests.</p>
                <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> HTTP request: <pre>GET http://localhost:5000/download?file=../../etc/passwd</pre> This returned sensitive system files.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Exposure of sensitive files, aiding further attacks.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Medium Findings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)</h4>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Poor access controls allowed users to access objects not intended for them by manipulating IDs.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Unauthorized data viewing, potentially leading to information disclosure.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Low Findings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)</h4>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Persistent XSS was detected in user-input fields, allowing script injection.</p>
                <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Input: <pre>POST http://localhost:5000/submit?comment=&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;</pre> The script persisted and executed on page load.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Limited to session hijacking in affected contexts; low propagation risk.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <p>To address the identified vulnerabilities, implement the following remediation steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="critical">For SSRF:</span> Validate and sanitize all user-supplied URLs. Use allowlists for permitted domains and implement network segmentation.</li>
            <li><span class="high">For SQL Injection and Path Traversal:</span> Use parameterized queries (e.g., prepared statements in SQL) and enforce strict path validation. Apply input sanitization techniques like encoding.</li>
            <li><span class="medium">For IDOR:</span> Implement proper access controls, such as role-based authentication and indirect object references (e.g., using tokens).</li>
            <li><span class="low">For Stored XSS:</span> Escape user input on the server-side and use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate script execution.</li>
            <li><strong>General:</strong> Conduct regular security audits, apply patches promptly, and perform penetration testing. Monitor logs for suspicious activity using tools like SIEM systems.</li>
        </ul>
